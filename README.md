# Billboard Detector

## Overview
Billboard Detector is a Flutter application designed to detect and analyze billboards in images or real-time camera feeds. This project serves as a starting point for building a mobile application with Flutter, leveraging its capabilities for cross-platform development.

## Features
- **Billboard Detection**: Identify billboards in images or video streams using image processing techniques.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built with Flutter for seamless operation on both iOS and Android.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction.

- **Dart**: Included with Flutter, ensure the Dart SDK is properly configured.
- **IDE**: Use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with Flutter plugins installed.
- **Device/Emulator**: A physical device or emulator for testing the application.
