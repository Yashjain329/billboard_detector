# Billboard Detector

## About
Billboard Detector is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to detect and analyze billboards in images or real-time camera feeds. Leveraging image processing techniques, it offers a user-friendly interface and cross-platform support for iOS and Android, making it a versatile tool for identifying billboard content in various environments.

## Features
- **Billboard Detection**: Identify billboards in images or video streams using image processing techniques.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built with Flutter for seamless operation on both iOS and Android.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed. Follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set it up.
- **Dart**: Included with Flutter, ensure the Dart SDK is properly configured.
- **IDE**: Use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with Flutter plugins installed.
- **Device/Emulator**: A physical device or emulator for testing the application.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashjain329/billboard_detector.git
   cd billboard_detector
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   Ensure a device or emulator is connected.

### Key Files and Directories
- **lib/main.dart**: Initializes the app and sets up the root widget.
- **lib/models/**: Contains data models to structure billboard-related data.
- **lib/services/**: Handles core functionality like image processing and camera integration.
- **lib/utils/**: Includes helper functions for tasks like image resizing or error handling.
- **lib/widgets/**: Reusable UI components to maintain a consistent look and feel.
